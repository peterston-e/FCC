                <p>The Application Programmer’s Interface to Python gives C and C++ programmers access to the Python
                    interpreter at a variety of levels. The API is equally usable from C++, but for brevity it is
                    generally referred to as the Python/C API. There are two fundamentally different reasons for using
                    the Python/C API. The first reason is to write extension modules for specific purposes; these are C
                    modules that extend the Python interpreter. This is probably the most common use. The second reason
                    is to use Python as a component in a larger application; this technique is generally referred to as
                    embedding Python in an application.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>PY</li>
                </ul>
                <code>
                    #define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
                    #include Python.h 
                </code>
                <p>
                    Many API functions are useful independent or whether you are embedding or extending Python;
                    moreover,
                    most applications that embed Python will need to provide a custom extension as well, so it’s
                    probably a good idea to become familiar with writing an extension before attempting to embed Python
                    in a real application.

                <p>
                    If you’re writing C code for inclusion in CPython, you must follow the guidelines and standards
                    defined in PEP 7. These guidelines apply regardless of the version of Python you are contributing
                    to. Following these conventions is not necessary for your own third party extension modules, unless
                    you eventually expect to contribute them to Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All function, type and macro definitions needed to use the Python/C API are included in your code by
                    the following line:
                </p>
                <code>
                    static inline Py_ALWAYS_INLINE int random(void) { return 4; }
                </code>
                <ul>
                    <li>Py_CHARMASK(c)</li>
                    <li>Py_DEPRECATED</li>
                    <li>Py_GETENV(s)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In release mode, the macro helps the compiler to optimize the code, and avoids a warning about
                    unreachable code. For example, the macro is implemented with __builtin_unreachable() on GCC in
                    release mode.

                <p>
                    Most Python/C API functions have one or more arguments as well as a return value of type PyObject*.
                    This type is a pointer to an opaque data type representing an arbitrary Python object. Since all
                    Python object types are treated the same way by the Python language in most situations (e.g.,
                    assignments, scope rules, and argument passing), it is only fitting that they should be represented
                    by a single C type. Almost all Python objects live on the heap: you never declare an automatic or
                    static variable of type PyObject, only pointer variables of type PyObject* can be declared. The sole
                    exception are the type objects; since these must never be deallocated, they are typically static
                    PyTypeObject objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All Python objects (even Python integers) have a type and a reference count. An object’s type
                    determines what kind of object it is (e.g., an integer, a list, or a user-defined function; there
                    are many more as explained in The standard type hierarchy). For each of the well-known types there
                    is a macro to check whether an object is of that type; for instance, PyList_Check(a) is true if (and
                    only if) the object pointed to by a is a Python list.
                </p>
                <code>
                    let y = 13.
                </code>
                <p>
                    A safe approach is to always use the generic operations (functions whose name begins with PyObject_,
                    PyNumber_, PySequence_ or PyMapping_). These operations always create a new strong reference (i.e.
                    increment the reference count) of the object they return. This leaves the caller with the
                    responsibility to call Py_DECREF() when they are done with the result; this soon becomes second
                    nature.

                <p>
                    The Python programmer only needs to deal with exceptions if specific error handling is required;
                    unhandled exceptions are automatically propagated to the caller, then to the caller’s caller, and so
                    on, until they reach the top-level interpreter, where they are reported to the user accompanied by a
                    stack traceback.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Py_XDECREF(item);</li>
                    <li>Py_XDECREF(const_one);</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For C programmers, however, error checking always has to be explicit. All functions in the Python/C
                    API can raise exceptions, unless an explicit claim is made otherwise in a function’s documentation.
                    In general, when a function encounters an error, it sets an exception, discards any object
                    references that it owns, and returns an error indicator. If not documented otherwise, this indicator
                    is either NULL or -1, depending on the function’s return type. A few functions return a Boolean
                    true/false result, with false indicating an error. Very few functions return no explicit error
                    indicator or have an ambiguous return value, and require explicit testing for errors with
                    PyErr_Occurred(). These exceptions are always explicitly documented.
                </p>
                <code>
                    def incr_item(dict, key):static struct PyModuleDef 
                </code>
                <p>
                    As a general principle, a function that calls another function to perform some task should check
                    whether the called function raised an exception, and if so, pass the exception state on to its
                    caller. It should discard any object references that it owns, and return an error indicator, but it
                    should not set another exception — that would overwrite the exception that was just raised, and lose
                    important information about the exact cause of the error.

                    The one important task that only embedders (as opposed to extension writers) of the Python
                    interpreter have to worry about is the initialization, and possibly the finalization, of the Python
                    interpreter. Most functionality of the interpreter can only be used after the interpreter has been
                    initialized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic initialization function is Py_Initialize(). This initializes the table of loaded modules,
                    and creates the fundamental modules builtins, __main__, and sys. It also initializes the module
                    search path (sys.path).
                </p>
                <code>
                     const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                    "otherValue";
                </code>
                <p>
                    On most systems (in particular, on Unix and Windows, although the details are slightly different),
                    Py_Initialize() calculates the module search path based upon its best guess for the location of the
                    standard Python interpreter executable, assuming that the Python library is found in a fixed
                    location relative to the Python interpreter executable. In particular, it looks for a directory
                    named lib/pythonX.Y relative to the parent directory where the executable named python is found on
                    the shell command search path (the environment variable PATH).

                    Python can be built with several macros to enable extra checks of the interpreter and extension
                    modules. These checks tend to add a large amount of overhead to the runtime so they are not enabled
                    by default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A full list of the various types of debugging builds is in the file Misc/SpecialBuilds.txt in the
                    Python source distribution. Builds are available that support tracing of reference counts, debugging
                    the memory allocator, or low-level profiling of the main interpreter loop. Only the most frequently
                    used builds will be described in the remainder of this section.
                </p>
                <code>
                    configure --with-trace-refs

                <p>
                    In addition to the reference count debugging described below, extra checks are performed, see Python
                    Debug Build.

                    All user visible names defined by Python.h (except those defined by the included standard headers)
                    have one of the prefixes Py or _Py. Names beginning with _Py are for internal use by the Python
                    implementation and should not be used by extension writers. Structure member names do not have a
                    reserved prefix.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The header files are typically installed with Python. On Unix, these are located in the directories
                    prefix/include/pythonversion/ and exec_prefix/include/pythonversion/, where prefix and exec_prefix
                    are defined by the corresponding parameters to Python’s configure script and version is '%d.%d' %
                    sys.version_info[:2]. On Windows, the headers are installed in prefix/include, where prefix is the
                    installation directory specified to the installer.
                </p>

                <code>
                    if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2)
                </code>

                <p>
                    C++ users should note that although the API is defined entirely using C, the header files properly
                    declare the entry points to be extern "C". As a result, there is no need to do anything special to
                    use the API from C++.
