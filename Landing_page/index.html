            <h2>Raw Honey</h2>
            <p>
                Raw honey has been used for at least 10,000 years playing a vital role in health, religious and cultural
                traditions. Raw honey is essentially the same as the honey found in a beehive, except it’s been treated
                to a filtration process that includes straining the honey through a mesh or nylon cloth to eliminate
                impurities like dead bees and beeswax.
                Aside from the filtration, raw honey is honey in its pure, unheated, unpasteurized, and unprocessed
                form. This is perhaps one of the most important characteristics and health benefits of the final
                product, as it preserves all the natural vitamins, essential minerals, enzymes, phytonutrients, and
                other nutritional elements.
                it is normal for raw honey to contain particles of bee pollen, honeycomb bits, and propolis. These
                inclusions contribute to the popularity of raw honey because they can be beneficial to overall health.

            <h2>Health Benifits</h2>
            <p>
                Raw honey contains a wide variety of nutrients.

                It has approximately 22 amino acids, 31 different minerals and a wide range of vitamins and enzymes.
                However, the nutrients are only present in trace amounts.

                What’s most impressive about raw honey is that it contains nearly 30 types of bioactive plant compounds.
                These are called polyphenols, and they act as antioxidants.

                Many studies have linked these antioxidants with impressive health benefits, including reduced
                inflammation and a lower risk of heart disease and certain cancers.

                Conversely, commercial honeys may contain fewer antioxidants due to processing methods.

                For example, one study compared the antioxidants in raw and processed honey from a local market. They
                found that the raw honey contained up to 4.3 times more antioxidants than the processed variety.

                Interestingly, one unofficial study by the US-based National Honey Board found that minimally processed
                honey contains levels of antioxidants and minerals that are similar to those of raw honey.

                However, there are very few studies comparing the two types. More research in this area can help shed
                light on the impact of processing on the antioxidants in honey.

            <h2>How to Choose the Healthiest Honey</h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to choosing the healthiest honey, you should look for one that is raw.

                Raw honeys are not pasteurized and bypass filtration, a process that may reduce its nutrients.

                A great variety of raw and unfiltered honey is available on Amazon.

                While minimally processed honeys are not bad, it’s hard to know which ones are minimally processed
                without actually performing tests beforehand.

                If you would prefer a minimally processed honey because of its texture, it’s best to buy it from a local
                beekeeper, as they are far less likely to be ultrafiltered.
