                androgynous
                persona;[7][8] his wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams;
                and
                his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his
                recordings.[9] His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave,
                soul,
                synth-pop, pop, jazz, blues, and hip hop. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the Minneapolis
